<h1> Hey there 👋 </h1>

I'm a seasoned software engineer with expertise in frontend technologies like React and backend frameworks like Node.js. I build end-to-end web applications, ensuring seamless user experiences across different devices. 

I'm well-versed in DevOps practices and have a growing interest in AI.

I have contributed to various open-source projects, such as [Firefox profiler](https://github.com/firefox-devtools/profiler) and I love sharing my knowledge and experiences through mentorship and tech articles on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/mariehposa).

Aside from software engineering, I have a keen interest in adventurous travel✈️ and exploring new recipes🧑‍🍳.

Please feel free to contact me through [Email](mailto:mariamadedeji.work@gmail.com). Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with you!😊
